# Hum-An Translator


## Basic Details
### Team Name: ERROR 404


### Team Members
- Team Lead: Priya Roy - Viswajyothi College of Engineering and Technology
- Member 2: Deena George - Viswajyothi College of Engineering and Technology

### Project Description
A fun web app that lets humans speak or type a message, detects the emotion, and translates it into an animal sound of their choice (dog, cat, or cow) — because sometimes “woof” says it better than words.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Humans and animals can’t understand each other… and frankly, animals are tired of humans talking too much without barking, meowing, or mooing for a change.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We made a translator that takes your voice or text and turns it into context-based animal sounds — bridging the “species gap” one bark at a time.

## Technical Details
### Technologies/Components Used
For Software:
-Languages: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
-Frameworks: None (pure vanilla awesomeness)
-Libraries: Web Speech API (for speech recognition)
-Tools: VS Code, Local Server

For Hardware:
-Microphone (built-in or USB) for voice input
-Speakers or headphones to hear your glorious meows and moos
